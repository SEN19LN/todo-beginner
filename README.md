# ToDo Beginner

A very simple ToDo web app for beginners, built with Go.

## Features

- Add tasks
- Set due date
- Set duration (minutes)
- Set cost (yen)
- Mark tasks as done
- Local file save (JSON)

## Why I made this

I started learning programming with no experience.
At first, I couldn't understand most of the code.

By using AI as a learning tool, I built this app step by step.
I focused on "finishing" rather than "being perfect".
